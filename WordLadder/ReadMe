Purpose: The purpose of this code is to take two five letter words like "store" and "money" and create a word ladder between them.
A word ladder is a list of words connecting "store" to "money" by changing one letter at a time. The code generates two ladders. The first ladder generated is generated by using a BFS method and the second ladder generated is using a DFS.
When running the code, the code request two words seperated by a space. The first word is the starting word and the second word is the ending word. Below is an example when the starting word is "store" and the ending word is "money".

For Example:
store money
a 9-rung word ladder exists between store and money.
store
shore
chore
choke
